            <ul class = "uList">
                <li>Efficent to use! 5 menu buttons near the top of the page that allow the user to navigate to different pages</li>
                <li>Could be made more minimalistic by condensing menu buttons into a hamburger menu</li>
                <li>Not as learnable as it could be. Given that there are only a few actions that a user can take, such as donate or connect, it should be more learnable</li>
                <li>The tiles at the bottom of the page do not look like buttons -> less learnable</li>
                <li>The website is not very memorable. The front page feels simultaneously cluttered and blank. There is also not much color in the whole page</li>
            </ul>

                <li>WAIVE identified that the black text on white backgroundwas a "contrast error". This did not seem important, the text is easily readable </li>
                <li>It also identified text that was "too small" - but it was just copyright text</li>
                <li>In summary, I had no major findings from accessibility testing</li>
